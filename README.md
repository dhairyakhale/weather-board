# weather-board

**EDIT:** App not hosted anymore.

OpenWeatherMap API was used to acess the current weather data of various cities. Express/Node.js is used for backend, and HTML-CSS is used for front-end.
[OpenWeatherFont](https://websygen.github.io/owfont/) was used to display the current weather icon.

**Note:** The web-app is not responsive (yet)
